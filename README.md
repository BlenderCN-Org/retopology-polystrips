---------------

The Polystrips Retopology tool is an addon for Blender that provides quick and easy ways create the key face loops needed to retopologize a complex model. Use cases include complex forms, such as human faces, creatures, and other organic & hard-surface objects.

The tool works by hand-drawing strokes on to the high-resolution object. The strokes are instantly converted into spline-based strips of polygons, which can be used to quickly map out the key topology flow. Clean mesh previews are generated on the fly, showing you the exact mesh thatâ€™ll be created.

The add-on is available for purchase from the Blender Market: http://cgcookiemarkets.com/blender/all-products/polystrips-retopology-tool/
